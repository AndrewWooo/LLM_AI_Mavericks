Lately, I've been experiencing persistent headaches, especially in the afternoon and evenings. The pain is usually dull and located in the forehead and temples. Along with the headaches, I've noticed increased sensitivity to light and sound, which worsens the discomfort. Additionally, I've been feeling quite fatigued, even after a full night's sleep. It's been affecting my energy levels during the day and making it challenging to focus on my work.

Furthermore, I've been having occasional bouts of dizziness, especially when I stand up quickly or move my head suddenly. It almost feels like the room is spinning for a few seconds. I've also had some trouble with balance, and I've stumbled a couple of times in the past week.

For the past month or so, I've been experiencing discomfort in my abdomen. It's not painful, but it's a persistent feeling of fullness and bloating, especially after meals. I've tried to identify if certain foods trigger it, but it seems to happen regardless of what I eat.

In addition to the digestive issues, I've been having trouble sleeping. I find it hard to fall asleep, and even when I do, I wake up multiple times during the night. As a result, I wake up feeling tired and groggy every morning.

Recently, I've also noticed an increase in my heart rate, especially when I'm at rest. My pulse seems to be faster than usual, and sometimes I feel my heart pounding in my chest.

Over the past two weeks, I've been experiencing joint pain and stiffness, particularly in my wrists and fingers. It's most noticeable when I wake up in the morning, and it takes a while for the discomfort to subside. The pain improves as I start moving, but it's been bothering me throughout the day, making it difficult to type and carry out everyday tasks.

In addition to the joint issues, I've been feeling unusually fatigued, despite getting enough sleep at night. I've also noticed small red rashes on my legs and arms that come and go. These rashes aren't itchy, but they seem to appear randomly and then fade away after a day or two.

Lately, I've been noticing some changes in my vision. I've been experiencing blurred vision, especially when trying to read or focus on objects up close. It's becoming challenging to see small print, and I often find myself squinting to try and make things clearer.

In addition to the vision issues, I've been dealing with frequent urination, especially during the night. I wake up multiple times to use the bathroom, which is disrupting my sleep and leaving me feeling tired during the day.

Recently, I've also been experiencing stiffness and discomfort in my joints, particularly in my knees and hips. The pain worsens when I try to walk or stand for extended periods.

Moreover, I've been feeling unusually forgetful and finding it challenging to concentrate on tasks. I often misplace items and struggle to recall names and events that were once easy to remember.

In the past few weeks, I've been struggling with unexplained weight loss. Despite maintaining my usual eating habits, I've noticed a significant drop in my weight, which is concerning to me.

Moreover, I've been experiencing excessive thirst and frequent urination. I constantly feel the need to drink water, and I find myself using the restroom much more frequently than before.

In addition to these physical symptoms, I've been feeling increasingly anxious and irritable. Small things seem to trigger stress, and I often find it hard to relax or concentrate on my work.

Furthermore, I've been having difficulty falling asleep at night. My mind races with thoughts, and it takes me a long time to quiet my thoughts and finally drift off to sleep. As a result, I wake up feeling tired and unrested in the mornings.

Over the past month, I've been experiencing recurring episodes of abdominal pain and discomfort. The pain is often localized in the lower right quadrant and can sometimes be sharp and intense. It comes and goes, but it's been persistent enough to concern me.

In addition to the abdominal pain, I've noticed changes in my bowel habits. I've been having diarrhea more frequently, and my stools appear looser and sometimes contain mucus.

Moreover, I've been feeling fatigued and lacking in energy. Even after a good night's sleep, I struggle to feel refreshed and motivated during the day.

Recently, I've also been experiencing some unexplained skin rashes and itchiness. The rashes appear on different parts of my body and seem to come and go without any obvious triggers.
