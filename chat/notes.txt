// run the app: streamlit run chatWindow.py

1. `import openai`: This line imports the `openai` library, which is used to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

2. `import streamlit as st`: This line imports the `streamlit` library and aliases it as `st`. Streamlit is a Python library used for creating web applications with simple Python scripts.

3. `st.title("I am a Smart AI to help you find your doctor")`: This line sets the title of the Streamlit web application to "I am a Smart AI to help you find your doctor." This title will be displayed at the top of the web page.

4. `openai.api_key = st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`: This line sets the API key for the OpenAI GPT-3 API. The API key is retrieved from the Streamlit secrets, which allows you to securely store sensitive information like API keys.

5. `if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:`: This line checks if the key `"openai_model"` is present in the Streamlit session state. The session state is used to store information across different interactions with the web application.

6. `st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"`: If the `"openai_model"` key is not present in the session state, this line sets the default value for the model to be used with the OpenAI API to "gpt-3.5-turbo."

7. `if "messages" not in st.session_state:`: This line checks if the key `"messages"` is present in the Streamlit session state. The `"messages"` key is used to store the conversation messages between the user and the assistant.

8. `st.session_state.messages = []`: If the `"messages"` key is not present in the session state, this line initializes it as an empty list. This list will be used to store messages exchanged between the user and the AI assistant.

9. `for message in st.session_state.messages:`: This line starts a loop that iterates through the messages stored in the `st.session_state.messages` list.

10. `with st.chat_message(message["role"]):`: This line uses a context manager provided by Streamlit to display a chat message. The role of the message (either "user" or "assistant") is determined by `message["role"]`.

11. `st.markdown(message["content"])`: This line displays the content of the message using Markdown formatting. The content of the message is stored in `message["content"]`.

12. `if prompt := st.chat_input("What can I help you today?"):`: This line uses a walrus operator (`:=`) to both display a chat input box and capture the input value provided by the user. The user's input is stored in the `prompt` variable.

13. `st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})`: This line appends a new message to the `st.session_state.messages` list. The new message includes the user's role ("user") and the content of their input captured in the `prompt` variable.

14. `with st.chat_message("user"): st.markdown(prompt)`: This line displays the user's input as a chat message with the role "user."

15. `with st.chat_message("assistant"): ...`: This line displays the response from the AI assistant as a chat message with the role "assistant." The response is generated by the OpenAI GPT-3 model based on the conversation history between the user and the assistant.

16. `message_placeholder = st.empty()`: This line creates an empty placeholder to display the response from the assistant. The response will be updated dynamically during the conversation.

17. `full_response = ""`: This line initializes an empty string variable called `full_response` to store the complete conversation history with the assistant.

18. `for response in openai.ChatCompletion.create(...):`: This line starts a loop to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 API. It sends the conversation history to the API and receives a response from the assistant.

19. `full_response += response.choices[0].delta.get("content", "")`: This line appends the assistant's response to the `full_response` variable. The response is extracted from the API response using `response.choices[0].delta.get("content", "")`.

20. `message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + "▌")`: This line updates the content of the placeholder with the new response received from the assistant. The "▌" character is used to display the text as if it's being typed in real-time.

21. `message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)`: This line updates the content of the placeholder with the final version of the assistant's response.

22. `st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": full_response})`: This line appends the assistant's response to the `st.session_state.messages` list, which keeps track of the conversation history.

The code creates a simple chat interface where the user can interact with the AI assistant powered by the OpenAI GPT-3. The assistant responds to the user's inputs based on the conversation history. Each message is displayed as a chat bubble using Streamlit's chat message component.
